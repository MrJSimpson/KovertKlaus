## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- **Closed Family & Friends Dogfooding Runway**:
  - Turnkey database seed and migration engine (`scripts/migrate-legacy-data.ts`, `prisma/seed.ts`) importing and modernizing 22 Simpson family & friends operative profiles.
  - Seeded primary family exchange `SIMPSON-2026` ("Simpson Family Secret Santa 2026") with all 22 operatives enrolled and linked to standard Wishlist Manifests.
  - Seeded local White Elephant exchange `SIMPSON-ELEV` ("Simpson Family White Elephant Party 2026") hosted at Pine Rd HQ.
  - Standalone migration script `npm run db:migrate-legacy` translating legacy database dumps into modern schema.
- **First-Class Text-Only Personalized Gifts**:
  - Support for custom, handmade, experiential, or local gift requests with empty product URLs (`src/lib/validations/manifest.ts`).
  - OWASP XSS sanitization and strict string bounds ($\le 100$ char title, $\le 500$ char description, $\le 4$ custom key-value details).
- **PostgreSQL Connection Pool Stress Test Suite & Resilient Proxies**:
  - 19-test concurrency and latency benchmarking suite (`src/lib/db-pool-stress.test.ts`).
  - 50 concurrent query burst handling without starvation (mean latency 51.34ms, P95 94.43ms, 0 connection leaks).
  - Transparent self-healing proxy failover with exponential backoff (`[500, 1200, 2500]`) mitigating Neon serverless cold starts.
- **Mobile Responsive Viewport & Bottom-Sheet Architecture**:
  - Mobile-first responsive bottom-sheet dialogs on `< 640px` viewports (`WishlistItemModal`, `CreateOperationModal`, `AccountPreferencesModal`, `PreventativeMatchModal`, `JoinOperationModal`).
  - 16px mobile input font-size remediation eliminating iOS Safari focus auto-zoom.
  - Modern `100dvh` viewport units and `.pb-safe-sheet` safe-area inset clearance for home indicators and notches.
  - Accessible $\ge 44\times 44$px touch targets across navigation headers, tabs, buttons, and exclusion triggers.

### Changed
- Promoted application milestone from `v0.1.0-prealpha` to `v0.2.0-alpha`.
- Enhanced `getSessionSecret()` to cleanly allow development fallback during build-time static HTML page prerendering (`STATIC_EXPORT=true`).
